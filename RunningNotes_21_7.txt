 value="validate"
 It will validate whether the table definitions in db matches with the entity definitions 
 It will not change anything.. no write operations
 
 
 value = "update"
 
 It is not gonna drop
 It'll do update(changing)
 
  
 value = "create"
 
 -> create everything from scratch 
 
 
 Diff:
 create - drop: when persistance is closed, all data elements be wiped away
 create          when persistance is closed, all data elements NOT  wiped away
 
 hbm2ddl.auto create-drop :
If the value is create-drop then, Hibernate first checks for a table and do the necessary operations and finally drops the table after all the operations were completed.
 hbm2ddl.auto Create :
If the value is CREATE then the hibernate first drops the existing tables data and structure, then creates new tables and executes the operations on the newly created tables.
------------------------------


create-drop -> drop, create, drop
create      -> drop, create
update      - > update
validate    -> no writing
none        -> nothing 

READ entity
